# Backbone TodoMVC + ECMAScript 6

This repo contains an implementation of the Backbone TodoMVC app rewritten to use ES6 modules, classes and other features. Using the [Traceur compiler](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler), we're able to use these features in today's browsers with it being dynamically interpreted at runtime. 

Run `index.html` on a server to try out the app, or read `docs/app.html` for the literate Docco version.

## Docco compilation

* `npm install docco -g`
* `docco js/app.js` 
* Update the `docs` directory
